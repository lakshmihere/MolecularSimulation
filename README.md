# MolecularSimulation

This code is a code to generate coordinates of atoms in a cybic simulation box of box length 18.The number density of atoms is 0.75. The following are the parts of the  code.

		- (a). Create a simulation box of length 18, plot the initial RDF

		- (b). Get the Lennard Jones Potential which is shifted by 2.5
		
		- (c). NVT ensemble of Temperature 1.
		
		- (d). NPT ensemble of Pressure 1.011.
